** Stackberry **
=================

Stackberry is a Node.js application that uses Express.js to create a RESTful API for a MongoDB database. The application is a simple CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data from a MongoDB database. 

## Installation
=================

To install the application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once you have Node.js installed, you will need to install the dependencies for the application. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the application and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will install all of the dependencies for the application. Once the dependencies are installed, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory of the application. This file will contain the environment variables for the application. The .env file should look like this:

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/stackberry
```

You can start the application by running the following command:

```
node index.js
```
